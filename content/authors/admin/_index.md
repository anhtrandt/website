## About Me

I hold a Ph.D. in Finance from the University of Rochester. My research focuses on asset pricing, mutual funds, short selling, securities lending, and corporate governance, with an emphasis on investor behavior, fund strategies, and market dynamics. I'm particularly interested in how the decisions of both individual and institutional investors shape financial outcomes and influence market efficiency. My work has been published in the Journal of Financial Economics.
